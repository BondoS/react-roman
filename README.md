- Conversion from decimal to roman is calculated using the "subtractive" notation, not "additive" notation [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals).
  - Which means `I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X.` NOT `I, II, III, IIII, V, VI, VII, VIII, VIIII, X`, please notice the difference in `4` and `9`
- It is better to calculate numbers less than `3999` but I have included support to `1,000,000` one million which is **`MÌ…`** in roman numbers.
